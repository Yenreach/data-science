			<p class="">Dear Employees, Graduates and Job Seekers.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p class="">
				Over the past few years, the Nigerian labour market has seen a massive surge in the rate of unemployment and according to studies, this has been a result of two major factors. <br><br><br>
				First is the introduction and birthing of new technology..<br><br><br>
			</p>
			<p>With the birth and introduction of new technologies like Artificial intelligence (AI), Deep Learning (DL) Machine Learning,  IoT (Internet of Things) and the like, technology is fast replacing everyday human tasks. <br><br><br>
				Here's an example from the banking industry.. <br><br><br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<section class="px-4 py-12 bg-cream cream sm:px-12 md:px-24 lg:px-40">
			<p>
				As you might have noticed, ATMs are fast replacing cashiers, in that you can now simply find ATM machines around you where you can easily perform simple banking tasks ranging from cash withdrawals and bank transfers to more complex tasks like cash deposits. <br><br><br>
				With these rapid changes, the smart question should be, what then happens to the
				cashiers? <br><br><br>
				Well, as you might have noticed, many of them had to be laid off. <br><br><br>
			</p>
			<p>Same thing with the customer service department. <br><br><br>
				Machines are now responding to customer queries and resolving issues at a far
				faster pace than humans without being tired, taking days off, asking for vacation, or
				even asking for a raise. <br><br><br>
				Faced with these, employers are forced to opt for the easier route. <br><br><br>
				Which has to do with embracing more technology and narrowing down on human intervention which has invariably led to a massive increase in unemployment.  <br><br><br>
				And this is not just happening in the banking industry, but across every known sector
				you can think of. <br><br><br>
				Letting you know that in today's labour market, you are competing less with humans
				and more against machines. <br><br><br>
				Secondly and even more sad is the fact that.. <br><br><br>
				As technology is being embraced at scale, organisations are demanding a new kind
				of skill set. <br><br><br>
				One that allows them to tackle current organisational challenges in a more informed
				way. <br><br><br>
				Because as much as technology has made life easier, it has also created new problems, and solving these problems will require a new certain kind of skill set which unfortunately is not taught in our tertiary institutions. <br><br><br>
				And according to a study from <span class="underline">indiaemployerforum.org</span>,

			To prove this, let us take a look at the area of data analysis.. The “Collection,
			Processing and Interpretation of Data” <br><br><br>

			Take a look at this JUNE 2022 report from <span class="underline">www.business.com</span> <br><br><br>

					Top Organisations Are More Than Willing To Pay You Bountifully As A Professionally Trained Data Analyst.

				<br><br><br>
				With that said, the next logical question becomes… <br><br><br>
				“How Can I Become a Professional Data Analyst”?<br><br><br>
				While there are many free online courses you can find on YouTube which you can
				take.<br><br><br>
				It is expedient for you to understand that these top organisations are very particular about where you obtained the skill and your certification from, because of how much the skill is almost being adulterated.<br><br><br>
				Hence, aspiring data analysts and corporate brands have embraced qualified and
