				Nigeria Unemployment Rate Set To Hit Record
				33.3% In Q4 of 2022, However Major Companies Are
				Desperately In Need Of More Skilled Workers.
				Here's What To Do Today..

			<p class="font-bold mb-12">SOURCE: Statistica.com</p>
			<p class="mb-4">Dear Employee, Students and Job Seekers.</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Over the past few years, the Nigerian labour market has seen a massive surge in the
				rate of unemployment and according to study, this has been as a result of two major
				factors. <br><br>
				First is the introduction and birthing of new technology..
			</p>
			<p>With the birth and introduction of new technologies like Artificial intelligence (AI),
				Deep Learning (DL) Machine Learning, IoT (Internet of Things) and the likes,
				technology is fast replacing everyday human tasks. <br><br>
				Here's an example from the banking industry.. <br><br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<section class="bg-cream cream py-12 sm:px-12 md:px-24 lg:px-40 px-4">
			<p>
				As you might have noticed, ATM's are fast replacing cashiers, in that you can now
				simply find ATM machines around you where you can easily perform simple banking
				tasks ranging from cash withdrawals and bank transfers to more complex tasks like
				cash deposit. <br><br>
				With these rapid changes, the smart question should be, what then happens to the
				cashiers? <br><br>
				Well, as you might have noticed, many of them had to be laid off. <br><br>
			</p>
			<p>Same thing with the customer service department. <br><br>
				Machines are now responding to customer queries and resolving issues at a far
				faster pace than humans without being tired, taking days off, asking for vacation, or
				even asking for a raise. <br><br>
				Faced with these, employers are forced to opt for the easier route. <br><br>
				Which has to do with embracing more of technology and narrowing down on human
				intervention which has invariably led to the massive increase in unemployment. <br><br>
				And this is not just happening in the banking industry, but across every known sector
				you can think of. <br><br>
				Letting you know that in today's labour market, you are competing less with humans
				and more against machines. <br><br>
				Secondly and even more sad is the fact that.. <br><br>
				As technology is being embraced at scale, organisations are demanding a new kind
				of skill set. <br><br>
				One that allows them to tackle current organisational challenges in a more informed
				way. <br><br>
				Because as much as technology has made life easier, it has also created new
				problems, and solving these problems will require a new certain kind of skill set which
				unfortunately are not taught in our tertiary institutions. <br><br>
				And according to study from indiaemployerforum.org , unemployability now
				possesses an even more greater challenge than unemployment. <br><br>
				To prove this, let us take a look at the area of data analysis.. The “Collection,
				Processing and Interpretation of Data” <br><br>
				Take a look at this JUNE 2022 report from www.business.com <br><br>

				What does this tell you? <br><br>
				Well, I'm sure you know by now. <br><br>
				It is the fact that there is a massive shortage in the field of Data Analysis across <br><br>
				industries and organisations are more than willing to pay through their noses to get professionally
				trained data analysts and desperately retain them. <br><br>
				With that said, the next logical question becomes… <br><br>
				“How Can I Become a Professional Data Analyst”?<br><br>
				While there are many free online courses you can find on YouTube which you can
				take.<br><br>
				It is expedient you understand that organisations are very particular about where
				you obtained the skill and your certification from, especially when you see how much the field is almost
				being adulterated. <br><br>
				Hence, aspiring data analysts and corporate brands have embraced qualified and
				certified data analytics training firms to receive proper training. <br><br>
				In a bid to help you acquire a high paying soft skill that will help you secure a high paying job and
				also help you boost your portfolio that will give you an edge in the current labour market. <br><br>
